## Covid Report
Looking at the data provided, I am able to filter through the information and determine that the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. Also, if we filter through that same data, we are able to analyze it and determine that the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. Looking at the plot below, we can identify a positive correlation between time passed and the number of cumulative cases because as the date increases, the number of total cases also increases.

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

I also want to show the chart:


``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
